I installed a "leftrightpad" Python package, but it seems to have been infected with malware.

Can you recover the original flag.txt?

Please note:

This might be helpful: sudo docker run --rm -it --name serpentine -v $(pwd):/workspace python:3.13.0-bookworm /bin/bash

Don't forget to wrap the recovered flag in grey{}

Any submission that contains "fake_flag" will result in a 100 point penalty.
