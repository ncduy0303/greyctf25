Description:

I heard that RSA is vulnerable when you use small public exponents. But I like to repeat myself a lot!

I heard that RSA is vulnerable when you use small public exponents. So I made sure to use a bigger public exponent!

I heard that RSA is vulnerable when you use small public exponents. Now I can encrypt messages even if they are related!

I heard that RSA is vulnerable when you use small public exponents. Wait, why is there e in my ring of integers?

(NOTICE 2: Sorry the challenge isnt clear enough. e_power(x, ff, po) computes e^x over ff. As for po... What is an irrational number doing in an integer ring???)

(Note: The intended solution takes a BIIIT longer to run than your typical crypto solve script.

Please be patient, and have a ball of yarn on us!)
