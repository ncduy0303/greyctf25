Answer: LFE5U-25F-6BG256C

Success: Here's the 1st part of the flag:
grey{for_last_greyctf_

> qna2()
connect GP27 of the RP to GND
2nd part of the flag
i_was_

> qna3()
Next, we need to extract the key from the FPGA
I've imported the libraries busio and board for you.
Gimme some code to initialise uart at baud rate 9600 on board GP8 and GP9: uart = busio.UART(tx=board.GP8, rx=board.GP9, baudrate=9600)
Send the string '@---------------A@' excluding quotes to the uart: uart.write(b"@---------------A@")
Gimme some code to retrieve the key from the FPGA: key = uart.read(64)
Run qna4()

> qna4()
Enter the key you got from qna3(): {hi_i'm_your_army}
3rd part of the flag
holding_back...but_this_greyctf_i'm_no_longer_sleep_deprived}

Flag: grey{for_last_greyctf_i_was_holding_back...but_this_greyctf_i'm_no_longer_sleep_deprived}
