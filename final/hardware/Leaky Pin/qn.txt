Stop the backend and run this in the Thonny REPL to start the challenge.


from leaky_gpio25 import *

>>> from leaky_gpio25 import *
Calling secret_in_gpio25() causes bits to fly through GPIO25 at blazing speed (150Mhz!). Maybe one of the chip's feature could help us catch it?
>>> secret_in_gpio25()
I leaked the secret in GPIO25! Catch me if you can!
