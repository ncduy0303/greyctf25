# Fun Challenges

### SMD Skills

Get a 48MHz oscillator from the staff. You can solder it to the badge, read the flag from UART.
Make sure to set the Solder Bridge to the right option. If in doubt ask Hackin7.

Once soldered, go to UART mode and send "@---------------B@" to the UART

### Fast Secure Memory

Secure Memory but at 50MHz instead of 10Hz
