 * @returns
 * A safe version of the Node.js `fs` module, guarded against path traversal
 * attacks and absolute path usage.
 *
 * All interfaces are exactly the same as the original `fs` module,
 * but all file paths are resolved relative to the provided `basePath`
 * and are guaranteed to fall within the `basePath` when the `fs`
 * operations are executed.
 *
 * The use of file descriptors in place of a file path is not affected.
