I created a fairly easy competitive programming problem to test your algorithm coding skills. Please only use python3, c and cpp.

The remote judge compiles cpp code using g++ -DONLINE_JUDGE -fno-tree-ch -O2 -Wall -std=c++14, c code using gcc -DONLINE_JUDGE -fno-tree-ch -O2 -Wall -std=c99 and runs python3 code using python3.7.8.

Good luck and remember to flush your outputs! The rest of the information is in the pdf :)
